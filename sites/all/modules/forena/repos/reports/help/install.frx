  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  The information below details various drupal administration tasks related to forena, which are typically located within
  <a href="../admin/structure/forena" target="_self">forena structure</a> and
  <a href="../admin/config/content/forena" target="_self">forena configuration</a> (containing various tabs).
  </p>

  If you are aware of additional related items that you'd recommend to also include here,
  or you noticed anything already here that's incomplete or contains errors, please report about
  it in the <a href="https://drupal.org/node/2120833" target="_blank">forena issue queue</a>.

  <h2>Forena module upgrades</h2>
  <h3>About upgrading the forena module</h3>
  <p>
  The process to upgrade module forena is similar to upgrading any other Drupal module. However, after the standard upgrade
  activities are completed (e.g. including the database updates, if needed), there might be some additional drupal administration
  tasks required related to forena. Failing (forgetting) to do so may lead to situations where special warnings, errors, etc start
  to happen.
  </p>
  <h3>Post-upgrade situations that do require some additional drupal administration</h3>
  <p>
  Here is a (partial) list of scenarios that do require some extra drupal administration related to forena:
  </p>
  <table border="1">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th style="width: 40%;" align="left" valign="top"><strong>Scenario</strong></th>
        <td style="width: 60%;" scope="col" align="left" valign="top"><strong>Situation and required drupal admin action</strong></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th style="width: 40%;" align="left" valign="top">
        Upgrading to forena version 7.x-3.x (from a pre-7.x-3.x version, such as 7.x-2.x).
		</th>
        <td style="width: 60%;" scope="col" align="left" valign="top">
		When you try to edit the format of any report, e.g. a <a href="./sample.states/edit/format" target="_self">sample report</a>),
		you get a warning message like:<br/><br/>
		<i><u>Warning: array_merge() [function.array-merge]: Argument #1 is not an array in forena_format_form()
		(line 264 of .../modules/forena/forena.admin.inc).</u></i><br/><br/>
		This warning appears because the value for <b>skin</b> (in the same edit format window) is empty (blank).
		What is worse: you can't select any skin from the drop-down list because it is entirely empty.
		Continue reading the next item in this list to address this issue, after that issue is resolved come back to this item,
		pretty sure the drop-down list for the report you selected won't be empty anymore (and the warning won't show up
		anymore either).
		</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th style="width: 40%;" align="left" valign="top">
        Upgrading to forena version 7.x-3.x (from a pre-7.x-3.x version, such as 7.x-2.x).
		</th>
        <td style="width: 60%;" scope="col" align="left" valign="top">
		Using Drupal's administration option <a href="../admin/config" target="_self">Configuration</a>
		produces a warning message like:<br/><br/>
		<i><u>Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in form_select_options()
			(line 2675 of .../includes/form.inc).</u></i><br/><br/>
		This warning appears because the value for <b>Default report skin </b> on the
		<a href="../admin/config/content/forena" target="_self">forena configuration screen</a> (on the <b>general</b> tab)
		is empty (blank). What is worse: you can't select any Default report skin from the drop-down list there because it
		is entirely empty (also ...).<br/><br/>
		To resolve this (so that the drop-down list is no longer empty), 2 actions are needed (in the order specified):
		<ol>
		<li>
		Create a skin file (use any filename ending with .skinfo) in the root of the directory in the
		<a href="../admin/config/content/forena" target="_self">Report Repository</a>, e.g. by cloning it from the
		default_skin.skinfo located in the repos/reports subfolder of the forena module directory (using the same filename is fine).
		If you prefer to not do so manually, and it's OK for you to Revert all delivered reports to original (which will cause all
		customizations to module delivered reports to get lost, if they were customized in the prior forena release), then 
		simply check the checkmark in front of "Revert all delivered reports to orignial"
		on the <a href="../admin/structure/forena" target="_self">forena structure screen</a>. This will also copy the
		default_skin.skinfo to the root of the directory in the
		<a href="../admin/config/content/forena" target="_self">Report Repository</a>.
		</li>
		<li>
		hit the <b>clear cache</b> button on the <a href="../admin/structure/forena" target="_self">forena structure screen</a>.
		</li>
		</ol>
		</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

  <h2>To clear or not to clear (the forena cache)</h2>
  <h3>About the forena cache</h3>
  <p>
  Forena takes advantage of caching techniques, similar to caching that's available also for things like themes, menus, etc.
  This implies that there are some situations where you'll have to clear the forena cache also, using the <b>clear cache</b>
  button on the <a href="../admin/structure/forena" target="_self">forena structure screen</a>. Failing (forgetting) to do
  so will typically lead to situations where you changed 'something', but it doesn't seem to work (potentially because it isn't 
  activated yet). Also, in case something doesn't seem to work (yet) after you changed something, it doesn't hurt to clear
  the forena cache (it may start working after you did just that ...).
  </p>
  <h3>Situations that do require forena cache to be cleared</h3>
  <p>
  Here is a (partial) list of scenarios that do require to <a href="../admin/structure/forena" target="_self">clear the forena cache</a>:
  </p>
  <table border="1">
    <tbody>

		</th>
        <td style="width: 50%;" scope="col" align="left" valign="top">
		Such new skin will not yet show up in the pull-down list for setting it as the <b>Default report skin</b> on the

		instead the old skin name (before changing the name in the .skinfo file) will still show up (e.g. with the same name
		as in the .skinfo file where you cloned it from)
		</td>

  <h2>Text formats configuration</h2>
  <h3>Select a text formats configuration</h3>
  <p>
  Make sure the <b>text format</b> within <b>input formats</b> is set to <b>full HTML</b> within the
  <a href="../admin/config/content/forena" target="_self">forena configuration screen</a> (on the <b>general</b> tab).
  Especially if you're planning to use SVG graphs it is important to avoid that tags are being stripped out, as this could cause
  such graphs to not be shown at all (or with some error messages).
  </p>
  <p>
 As a variation, first
  <a href="../admin/config/content/formats/add" target="_self">define some new text format</a> (e.g.: Reporting HTML) and then
  set the text format to this new text format. The advantage of using some new text format is that the impact of tuning
  the selected filter (as detailed below) will be limited to forena reports only.
  </p>
  <h3>Tune the selected text format</h3>
  <p>
  Navigate to the <a href="../admin/config/content/formats" target="_self">configuration page related to text formats</a>
  (within content authoring) and select the text format you specified on the <a href="../admin/config/content/forena" target="_self">forena configuration screen</a>.
  Make sure these entries are turned of for the selected text format (within enabled filters):
  <ul>
  <li>Limit allowed HTML tags</li>
  <li>Display any HTML as plain text</li>
  <li>Convert line breaks into HTML</li>
  <li>Correct faulty and chopped off HTML</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <h3>Validate your text formats configuration</h3>
  <p>
  Assuming you completed the setup of your SVG graph library, you should now be in good shape to start using forena's amazing 
  charting features. To perform an easy validation about this, just checkout one of the SVG samples delivered with forena. 
  Use the <a href="./sample.state_summary_ie8" target="_self">external SVG graph sample</a> in case you're using an older browser
  that does not support inline SVG. Alternatively, if you're using a more recent browser, try using the
  <a href="./sample.state_summary" target="_blank">Master Summary with drill down</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you don't see a nicely formatted graph,
  but only some square with a grey background (about the size of the SVG graph you should see if it would have worked),
  or you're getting some error messages, you may want to checkout the issue queue on Drupal.org (search for <b>html filter</b>),
  such as in issue <a href="https://drupal.org/node/828458" target="_self">https://drupal.org/node/828458</a>.
