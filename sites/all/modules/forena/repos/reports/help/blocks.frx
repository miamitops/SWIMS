  <p>Custom data blocks are generally written as .sql files in a
    database repository. Below is the contents of the
    drupal/role_permissions data block that demonstrates role
    permissions.</p>
  <pre>
  --ACCESS=administer permissions
  SELECT * FROM {role_permission} p
    WHERE p.rid = :role
  </pre>
  <p>The content of a data block is a SQL statement.&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Security and data blocks</h3>
  <p>
    The line beginning with<strong>--ACCESS=<em>some_permission</em>
    </strong> is a required comment that indicates the permission required to
    access the data retrived by this block. The security for data block
    repository is configurable and pluggable, meaning that developers
    may create functions that determine how the permission is checked.
    In the drupal repository delivered with forena, access permissions
    are tested using the drupal user_access() function, so the value
    should match a drupal permission.
  </p>
  <p>In Drupal 7, drupal permissions passed to the user_access
    function are string keys that are usually lower cased versions of
    the rights found on the drupal permission tab. However, module and
    core developers may use any string that they want in creating
    rights. There is unfortunately no easy way in drupal to list module
    permissions, but after the permission has been granted to a role,
    you may use the {role_report} to determine</p>
  <h3>Parameters</h3>
  <p>
    The <strong>:role</strong> parameter in the example is named token
    that will be replaced in the SQL query with a parameter from the
    report. The parameter replacement is done by forena in a way that
    protects against SQL injection. Although these tokens are modeled
    after a commonly used database binding syntax, the replacement is
    done by Forena. Use this sytax instead of the native parameter
    binding for any database you are accessing with Forena. Tokens may
    be reference multiple times within the same SQL query.
  </p>
  <h3>Parameter Data Types</h3>
  <p>All data coming in from parameter forms and from the url is considered string 
  data.  In some cases you may need to make sure that a data block casts the incoming parameters
  in a particular type.  Numeric values should be included in the SQL without surrounding quotes, but
  in a way that is safe from SQL injection attacks.   
  </p>
  <p>
  You can use the --INFO section of your data block to specify data types for parameters in the data block as is 
  seen in the following example: 
  </p>
  <pre>
  --ACCESS=access content
  SELECT nid FROM node 
    WHERE promote=1
      AND status=1
    ORDER BY sticky DESC, created 
  --IF=:limit
  LIMIT :limit 
  --ELSE 
  LIMIT 10
  --END
  --INFO
  type[limit]=int
  </pre>
  <p>In the above example, the :limit parameter is specified to be of type int.  The following type conversions are 
  currently supported:</p>
  <p><strong>int</strong> - Convert to an integer. This is useful for limit queries as in the above example. </p>
  <p><strong>numeric</strong> - Convert to a floating point number (e.g. 6.2)</p>
  <p><strong>array</strong> - Convert to an array.  This is useful for in clauses</p>
  <p><strong>date</strong> - Convert to an ISO representation of a date string in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MI:SS format.  PHP date
  creation syntax is supported, so you can use values like now + 1 year</p>
  <p><strong>unixtime</strong> - Convert to a unix timestamp version of time and treat this as an integer.   This is particularly 
  useful for working with drupal dates.  PHP date creation syntax is supported, so you can use values lke now + 1 year. </p>
  <h3>Conditional SQL</h3>
  <p>When building data blocks you can specifcy sections of sql that
    are only included if a particular parameter is present. This lets
    you create SQL that has optional filters that can be of signifciant
    complexity and don't get included unless needed. The following
    example illustrates this technique</p>
  <pre>
  --ACCESS=access content
  SELECT * from states
  --IF=:state
  WHERE code=:state
  --ELSE
  WHERE code='AL'
  --END
  ORDER BY NAME
  </pre>
  <p>In the above example the Where clause is only added when there
    is a value specified for :state. If no value for :state is provided
    the WHERE clause limits the selection to code of 'AL'. The order by
    clause is always included.</p>
  <h3>Includes</h3>
  <p>Blocks can be build from other data blocks. To accomplish this
    use the --INCLUDE directive as follows:</p>
  <pre>
  --ACCESS=access content
  SELECT * FROM (
  --INCLUDE=users_by_state
  ) t
  WHERE state=:state
  </pre>
  <p>Note that when icluding other data blocks you can only include
    blocks within the same repository, and that the security of the new
    datablock is the security that is used for that data. The --ACCESS
    line of the included block is ignored.</p>
  <h3>Drupal Entities</h3>
  <p>When using the Drupal data driver you can create data blocks that 
   load drupal entities instead of selecting columns from the database. To do this specify an entity_type and entity_id column 
   in the --INFO section of your data block as is shown in the following example: 
  </p>
  <pre>
  --ACCESS=access content
  SELECT nid, type, title, uid, sticky, promote from node WHERE type=:content_type
    and status=1 
    ORDER BY title
  --INFO
  ; This demonstrates loading node entities.
  entity_type = node
  entity_id = nid
  </pre>
  <p>The example illustrates loading a node, but any entity may be loaded.
